# CVE-2020-8165 Demo

Yet another demo of CVE-2020-8165, though in a more realistic implementation than most.

## Background

*CVE-2020-8165*

> A deserialization of untrusted data vulnernerability exists in rails < 5.2.4.3, rails < 6.0.3.1 that can allow an attacker to unmarshal user-provided objects in MemCacheStore and RedisCacheStore potentially resulting in an RCE.

## Implementation

The "Shouter" app has a caching feature in its `Shout` model where optional images that are submitted with a shout:string are cached in redis and retrieved from there rather than the DB. Because the vulnerable `Rails.cache.fetch` method is used to interact with the cache, this app is susceptible to CVE-2020-8165, and the results of the RCE are placed in the src of the `img` tags in the dashboard route.
